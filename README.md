# Q-Types classification using Ludwig

A question-type classifier, inspired by [superscriptjs/qtypes](https://github.com/superscriptjs/qtypes) which hasn't been updated in 5 years.

This code uses Uber's [Ludwig](https://uber.github.io/ludwig/) library to do the actual model generation

The `train.sh`, `visualize.sh` and `predict.sh` files are utility files that you can use to check things out
